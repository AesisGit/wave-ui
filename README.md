# Wave UI - NOT YET READY.

An emerging UI framework for Vue.js with only the bright side.

Like other UI frameworks, it is very flexible and easy to use. But Wave UI is also:

- Lightweight
- Very easy to override via CSS
- No `!important` everywhere
- No useless DOM wrappers inside UI elements
- Not written in pixels but in `rem`


## install - Not yet ready.
    npm i --S wave-ui
