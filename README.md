# Wave UI - NOT YET READY.

An emerging UI framework for Vue.js with only the bright side. `:bulb:`

Like other UI frameworks, Wave UI is very flexible and easy to use. But it is also:

- Lightweight
- Very easy to override via CSS
- No `!important` everywhere
- No useless DOM wrappers inside UI elements, really.
- A single `$base-font-size` variable rules all the sizes and spacings
- Powerful elements, e.g. write a navigation menu in a single line


## install - Not yet ready.
    npm i --S wave-ui
