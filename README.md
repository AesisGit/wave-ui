# Wave UI - COMING SOON.

An emerging UI framework for Vue.js with only the bright side. `:sunny:`

Like other UI frameworks, Wave UI is very flexible and easy to use. But it is also:

- Lightweight
- Providing powerful elements, e.g. write a navigation menu in a single line
- Free of useless DOM wrappers inside UI elements, really
- Very easy to override via CSS
- Avoiding the use of the `!important` keyword
- CSS-scoping to UI elements &amp; helper classes - no side-effect
- Handling all the sizes and spacings from a single `$base-font-size` variable that you can override
- Providing straightforward attributes and component names


## install - Coming soon.
    npm i --S wave-ui
